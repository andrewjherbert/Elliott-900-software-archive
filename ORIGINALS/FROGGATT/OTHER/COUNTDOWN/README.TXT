This folder contains two versions of a solver for the 
"Countdown" TV show numbers game, one in ALGOL, one 
in SIR.  The ALGOL is very slow compared to the SIR.

The ALGOL version takes as paper tape input the target
number followed by the 5 number cards and computes an
arithemtical combination of the number cards that 
generates the target number.  The result is punched to
tape.

The SIR version works interactively at the teletype and
expects the number cards to be input first, followed by
the target number.

The SIR version is an improved algorithm compared to the
Algol program.
