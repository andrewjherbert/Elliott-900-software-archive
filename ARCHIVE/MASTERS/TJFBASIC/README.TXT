920ABASIC is a version of TJF's BASIC patched by Chris Moller for use on a
920A computer at Aldenham School. It is orinted towards batch running of
programs punched on paper tape, whereas the original assumes interactive input.

920ABASIC requires that a program tape will be loaded imemdiately after the
program, and complete with LIST, RUN commands and data as required.  PRINT
output goes to the teleprinter.  The KEY command is a no-op.
